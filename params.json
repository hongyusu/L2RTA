Note that you might need to change the path of gcc compiler.\r\n\r\n\t\t`mex compute_topk_omp.c forward_alg_omp.c backward_alg_omp.c  CFLAGS=\"\\$CFLAGS -fopenmp -std=c99\" LDFLAGS=\"\\$LDFLAGS -fopenmp\" CC=\"/usr/bin/gcc\"`\r\n\t\t`mex find_worst_violator_new.c CFLAGS=\"\\$CFLAGS -fopenmp -std=c99\" LDFLAGS=\"\\$LDFLAGS -fopenmp\" CC=\"/usr/bin/gcc\"`\r\n\t\r\n   - To run RSTA algorithm, try following command in MATLAB, which will run the algorithm on a test sample of 'ArD15' dataset with 5 random spanning trees and maximum depth of K-best list being 2 \r\n\r\n\t\t`run_RSTA('ArD15','tree','5','1','1','2','2')`\r\n\r\n   - There are two PYTHON scripts:\r\n\r\n\t\tauto_run_RSTA.py\t\r\n\t\tauto_profile_RSTA.py\r\n\t\r\n   - The python scripts will run/profile Random Spanning Tree Approximation algorithm parallel on interactive cluster.\r\n   - The parallelism is for the purpose of multiple parameters and datasets.\r\n   - The scripts use the help of PYTHON 'thread' and 'queue' package.\r\n   - The framework looks at each combination of parameters as a job and pools all jobs into a job queue.\r\n   - A group of workers (computing nodes) are then activated, each will take and process from the queue the first job.\r\n   - If the job is not completed by the worker, the worker will push the job back to the queue, an other worker sill processe the job later on.\r\n   - A penalty system is implemented to make it difficult for worker to get job if the worker is somehow malfunctioning. \r\n   - There are thoughts need to be implemented.\r\n      - loss function should be scaled.\r\n   - Detailed description can be found from\r\n\r\n\t\t./inference_code/README.md\r\n\r\n   - Description of the GitHub repository\r\n      - This repository contains RTA algorithm with improved inference algorithm for update direction finding.
